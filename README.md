# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

##  Project Overview
This end-to-end machine learning project predicts house prices in Melbourne using various features like property size, location, and amenities. The project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data preprocessing to deployment.

##  Architecture
Data Collection → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Web App → Deployment



##  Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Advanced feature engineering (distance to CBD, property age, etc.)
- Multiple ML models comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
- Interactive web interface for predictions
- REST API endpoint
- Model performance visualization
- Geospatial analysis

##  Dataset
The dataset contains information about properties in Melbourne including:
- Property features (rooms, type, land size, building area)
- Location data (suburb, postcode, coordinates)
- Price information
- Historical data

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.12.3**
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Deployment**: Ready for Streamlit Cloud/Heroku
